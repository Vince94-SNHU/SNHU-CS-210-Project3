# SNHU-CS-210-Project3

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project includes a grocery store system written in C++ that tracks items and displays count within a list of items.

What did you do particularly well?
     I thought I did well with laying out the main logic and relating classes to run individually as they are called vs having one large main file.  I also think the way the external file handling was managed well to ensure the file is not damaged when accessed.
     
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I think the code can be enhanced to add additional documentation and add abilities to further edit the repository list so that the program functions similar to a database that is queried against vs a display of list.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The file handling was a challenge for me as I encountered issues with accessing the files so the data was pulled and displayed properly.  I was able to watch tutorials on C++ and learned that files should be opened queried and closed properly to ensure integrity. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    File handling, queries and table displays are the most common, however I think the logic on the main file that triggers class events will be useful to keep data clean.  I use this a lot with other programming languages like Visual basic - I create a main file that runs the logic and calls other classes to run specific tasks.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Continue development and expand into full read/write software that functions properly in a real world scenario.
